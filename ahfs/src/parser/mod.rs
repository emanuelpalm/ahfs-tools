/// Parses given source code texts into boxed slice of [`Triple`s][tri].
///
/// # Syntax
///
/// A valid source code text contains only triples. A triple is three  _words_,
/// separated by whitespace, followed by an _end_ designator. The _end_
/// designator can either be a simple semi-colon `;`, or curly braces containing
/// a description of the triple. A _word_ may consist of any characters except
/// for whitespace, `;` `{` or `}`. A description _end_ designator is closed by
/// the same number of consecutive closing curly braces it was opened with,
/// meaning that the opening and closing can be adjusted to allow patterns of
/// curly braces to be used inside a description. There is no way to express
/// comments ignored by the parser.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ahfs
/// Orchestrator type System;
/// Orchestrator consumes ServiceDiscovery {
///     The service is consumed to allow the Orchestrator to make itself
///     findable by other services.
/// }
/// Orchestrator produces Orchestration {{
///     As this description was opened with two consecutive `{` characters,
///     it is not closed until it encounters two consecutive `}` characters.
///     Any number of `{` can be used to open a description, as long as the
///     same number of `}` are used to close it.
/// }}
/// ```
