    /// # Syntax
    ///
    /// A valid source code text contains only triples. A triple is three
    /// _words_, separated by whitespace, followed by an _end_ designator. The
    /// _end_ designator can either be a simple semi-colon `;`, or curly braces
    /// containing a description of the triple. A _word_ may consist of any
    /// characters except for whitespace, `;` `{` or `}`. A description _end_
    /// designator is closed by the same number of consecutive closing curly
    /// braces it was opened with, meaning that the opening and closing can be
    /// adjusted to allow patterns of curly braces to be used inside a
    /// description. There is no way to express comments ignored by the parser.
    ///
    /// # Example
    ///
    /// ```ahfs
    /// Orchestrator type System;
    /// Orchestrator consumes ServiceDiscovery {
    ///     The service is consumed to allow the Orchestrator to make itself
    ///     findable by other services.
    /// }
    /// Orchestrator produces Orchestration {{
    ///     As this description was opened with two consecutive `{` characters,
    ///     it is not closed until it encounters two consecutive `}` characters.
    ///     Any number of `{` can be used to open a description, as long as the
    ///     same number of `}` are used to close it.
    /// }}
